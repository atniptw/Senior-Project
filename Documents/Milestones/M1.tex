\section{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}[label*=3.\arabic*]
\item Should the orientation be north up or heading up or should we include both? If so what should the default be?
\item What is the "other relevant information" that will be displayed on the map?
\item Will we have to display multiple types of map tiles (i.e. satellite or street)?
\item Will we have any control/knowledge in how map tile data is sent to the device (i.e. filetype and format)?
\item Can we get sample map data from Raytheon?
\item What will be the restrictions on zoom level, since it alters how many tiles need to be stored on the device?
\item When/how should the device pull map tile data from the server?
\item Does the view follow the user as he/she travels?
\item Does the server have connection to the Internet?
\item What ways should the device connect to the server?
\item Will there be any views aside from the map?
\item What happens if the connection is lost?
\item What happens when connection is regained?
\item How is the connection initially established?
\item Should we disable the device from turning off the display?
\item What happens during/after a critical error with the device?
\item Can this be an open source project, as we may run into GPL licensing issues?
\item Who is maintaining code after the project finishes?
\item Who is going to be using the system?
\item What existing functionality needs to be carried over?
\end{enumerate}
