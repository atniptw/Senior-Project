\section{Introduction}
This document details all documentation associated with this project.  It includes the problem statement, requirements, project plan, and metrics.

\section{Problem Statement}
\subsection{User/Stakeholder Descriptions}
\subsubsection{Users} 
\textbf{Soldier, Police Officers, and other Ground Personnel}\\
The users of our program are seeking to maintain their situational awareness in locations which may not have connectivity to the Internet.  Many of them use voice guided situational awareness technology, but in light of advances in mobile devices, they could receive this information in a visual manner.  

\subsubsection{Stakeholders}
\textbf{Raytheon}\\
Raytheon's customers are mainly military organizations, many of which are using Raytheon's current situational awareness technologies.  Raytheon is looking to update these technologies to keep their position as a leading provider of military systems.\\ \\
\textbf{JD Hill}\\
JD is the client who proposed this solution.  He is a major proponent of using mobile devices in a military application.\\ \\
\textbf{Doug Duesseau}\\
Doug is the acting Technical Lead for this project. \\ \\
\textbf{Development Team}\\
The development team on this project are graduating seniors who wish to learn more about the software development process and interaction with a client.  They are very interested in learning more about developing on the Android platform.

\section{Metrics}
\subsection{Project}
\subsubsection{Documentation}
The progress of the documentation will be tracked by breaking it down into three parts: the percent written and ready for review, the percent that has been reviewed, and the percent that is ready for delivery. The initial portion will encompass the percentage of the requirements, features, and other material that have been documented according to our currently known goals. A portion of the documentation will be considered in the reviewed stage once Dr. Wollowski and/or JD Hill have provided feedback and approval. Once a section of the documentation is in its final state (written, reviewed, and stable), it will be considered complete.\\ \\
\begin{tabular}{l r}
Percent Written: & 0 \\
Percent Reviewed: & 0 \\
Percent Complete: & 0 \\
\end{tabular}
\subsubsection{Code}
During the coding phase of this project, progress will be tracked by the features scheduled during an iteration and the number of features completed. Code will belong to one of five phases â€“ unwritten, written, peer reviewed, tested, or complete. Once code has been written and passes the required unit tests, it will undergo a peer review to check for good coding practices, clarity, and errors. After a peer review the functionality will then be required to pass integration tests. Once it has passed system integration, it will be considered complete and will be merged into the main branch of code.\\ \\
\begin{tabular}{l r}
Percent Written: & 0 \\
Percent Reviewed: & 0 \\
Percent Tested: & 0 \\
Percent Complete: & 0 \\
\end{tabular}
\subsubsection{Testing}
For the final phase of the project, progress will be measured by how many tests are passing. The tests that the software will be subjected to will be more thorough than the tests required for code to join the main branch. Most tests will be automated, but there will also be human factor tests.\\ \\
\begin{tabular}{l r}
Percent Passing: & 0 \\
\end{tabular}
\subsection{Process}
The process that the project is following will be measured by due dates met versus missed due dates.\\ \\
\begin{tabular}{l r}
Milestone Dates Kept: & 0 \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Communication}
Communication will be measured by how well the team feels that their needs are being heard and being taken care of, along with efficiency of meetings.\\ \\
\begin{tabular}{l r}
Team Confidence: & 0 \\
Meetings: & 0 \\
\end{tabular}
